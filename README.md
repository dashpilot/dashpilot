### About Me

I'm a Dutch full-stack developer (js/nodejs/php) constantly exploring new ways of handling content-management (headless, inline-editing, JamStack, serverless). Fluent in Svelte and experienced with Vue. I also develop plugins and serverless functions for Netlify, S3 and Vercel.

## Serverless Functions (Netlify/Vercel)
- [Netlify Build Status Widget](https://github.com/dashpilot/netlify-build-status-widget) - Widget that shows the current status of your Netlify builds. Ideal for use with Netlify CMS
- [Netlify Identity - Git Gateway](https://github.com/dashpilot/netlify-identity-git-gateway) -Example of how to use Netlify Identity and Git Gateway to save files to Github (without using Netlify CMS)
- [Quickstart Netlify Spaces/S3](https://github.com/dashpilot/quickstart-netlify-spaces) - Netlify serverless functions for saving data to Amazon S3 or Digitalocean Spaces
- [S3 JSON DB](https://github.com/dashpilot/s3-json-db) - Use Amazon S3 as a simple JSON database and serverless API
- [Vercel Serverless backend](https://github.com/dashpilot/vercel-serverless-backend) - Save data to S3 or Github straight from your front-end app using Vercel functions

## Vue 3 Page Builder
- [Vue Pagebuilder](https://github.com/dashpilot/vue-pagebuilder) Vue 3 Page Builder


## Svelte Headless CMS
- [Dashpilot Headless CMS](https://github.com/dashpilot/dashpilot-headless-cms) - Headless, multi-site CMS written in Svelte

## Under development and experiments

### Inline Editors
- [Svelte inline editor](https://github.com/dashpilot/svelte-inline-editor) Inline on-page editor, works with Svelte Templates
- [HTML template editor](https://github.com/dashpilot/html-template-editor) Inline on-page editor, works with any html template

## Other
- [Vanilla SPA](https://github.com/dashpilot/vanilla-spa) Single page app and router without a framework, written in vanilla JS. Uses handlebars for templating

<!--

- [Sitefiction](https://sitefiction-builder.dashpilot.vercel.app/) Most fully featured version, built with Svelte
- [Sitefiction, different approach](https://sitefiction-data-attr.vercel.app/) Svelte experiment that uses live-editing via a panel on the side, features image upload and can be used with non-Svelte templates
