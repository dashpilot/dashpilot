### About Me

I'm a Dutch full-stack developer (js/nodejs/php) constantly exploring new ways of handling content-management (headless, inline-editing, JamStack, serverless). Fluent in Svelte and experienced with Vue. I also develop plugins and serverless functions for Netlify, S3 and Vercel.

### Serverless Functions (Netlify/Vercel)
- [Netlify Build Status Widget](https://github.com/dashpilot/netlify-build-status-widget) - Widget that shows the current status of your Netlify builds. Ideal for use with Netlify CMS
- [Netlify Identity - Git Gateway](https://github.com/dashpilot/netlify-identity-git-gateway) -Example of how to use Netlify Identity and Git Gateway to save files to Github (without using Netlify CMS)
- [Quickstart Netlify Spaces/S3](https://github.com/dashpilot/quickstart-netlify-spaces) - Netlify serverless functions for saving data to Amazon S3 or Digitalocean Spaces
- [S3 JSON DB](https://github.com/dashpilot/s3-json-db) - Use Amazon S3 as a simple JSON database and serverless API
- [Vercel Serverless backend](https://github.com/dashpilot/vercel-serverless-backend) - Save data to S3 or Github straight from your front-end app using Vercel functions
